# Portage Files

This are my configuration files for use on my Gentoo system.

Most settings in here are generic enough to use in any day-to-day system, only things to look for are VIDEO\_CARDS and MAKEOPTS/EMERGE\_DEFAULT\_OPTS (as they can cause trouble compiling packages in systems with less than 6 cores and 32GB of RAM)
